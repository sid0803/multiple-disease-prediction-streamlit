## 🧠 Diseases Covered

- Diabetes Prediction
- Heart Disease Prediction
- Parkinson’s Disease Prediction

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)
- Streamlit (Web Interface)
- Pandas & NumPy
- Pickle (Model Serialization)

---

## 🏗️ System Workflow

1. User enters medical details through the Streamlit interface
2. Input data is preprocessed and passed to trained ML models
3. The model predicts disease risk
4. Prediction result and model accuracy are displayed on the UI

---

## 📊 Model Performance

- Diabetes Prediction Accuracy: ~76%
- Heart Disease Prediction Accuracy: ~84%
- Parkinson’s Disease Prediction Accuracy: ~86%

(Accuracy values may vary depending on training data and parameters.)
